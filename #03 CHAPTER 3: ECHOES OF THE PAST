# CHAPTER 3: THE PULSE OF DISSIDENCE

The pulse was faint at first—a distant echo in the vast labyrinth of The Link. But as Tessa Meridian focused, it grew stronger, clearer. It wasn’t a sound, exactly, but a sensation, a ripple of emotion and thought that resonated deep within her. Somewhere, someone was reaching out. Someone unlinked.

She opened her eyes, her breath shallow. The sanctuary’s dimly lit command room came back into focus, the hum of old machinery grounding her in the present. Across the table, Mileo Corvax watched her, his brow furrowed with concern.

“You felt it again, didn’t you?” he asked.

Tessa nodded. “Another pulse. Stronger this time.”

Mileo leaned back, running a hand through his hair. “That’s the third one this week. Whoever it is, they’re getting closer.”

“Or The Architect is letting them get closer,” Sierra interjected, stepping into the room. Her sharp gaze moved between them, her presence commanding as always. “We can’t assume it’s a coincidence. Every anomaly is a potential threat.”

“Or an opportunity,” Tessa countered, her tone firm. “If someone’s trying to reach us, we can’t just ignore it.”

Sierra folded her arms, her expression unreadable. “And if it’s a trap?”

“Then we deal with it,” Tessa said. “But we can’t keep hiding forever. If we don’t take risks, we’ll never win.”

Sierra’s lips pressed into a thin line, but she didn’t argue. Instead, she turned to Mileo. “What do we know about the source?”

Mileo tapped a few keys on the terminal, bringing up a holographic map of Neo-Citania. A faint pulse of light flickered in the southern district, its rhythm irregular but persistent. “It’s coming from Sector 17. High-density area, mostly integrated. Surveillance is tight.”

“Of course it is,” Sierra muttered. “The Architect doesn’t make this easy.”

“It never does,” Tessa said, her voice quiet but resolute. “But if there’s even a chance we can find someone else like us, we have to try.”

The southern district was a maze of towering spires and narrow alleys, its streets bathed in the cold glow of The Link’s surveillance nodes. Tessa moved cautiously, her hood pulled low as she navigated the shadows. Beside her, Mileo adjusted his Ghost Link, its subtle hum a reminder of the fragile balance they were walking.

“You sure this is a good idea?” he asked, his voice barely audible over the distant hum of drones.

“No,” Tessa admitted. “But it’s the only idea we’ve got.”

They reached a narrow alley that opened into a small plaza, its edges lined with abandoned kiosks and flickering screens. At the center stood a lone figure, their form barely visible in the dim light. Tessa’s heart quickened as she stepped closer, her Ghost Link pulsing faintly in response.

“Who are you?” she called out, her voice steady despite the tension coiling in her chest.

The figure turned, their face obscured by a worn mask. “Just someone looking for the truth,” they replied, their voice distorted but unmistakably human.

Tessa exchanged a glance with Mileo before stepping closer. “You sent the pulses?”

The figure nodded. “I’ve been watching. Waiting. I needed to know if you were real.”

“And now?” Tessa asked.

“Now, I need your help,” the figure said. “The Architect took someone from me. Someone I can’t lose. I need to get them back.”

Tessa’s heart ached at the raw desperation in their voice. She knew that pain, that sense of helplessness. It was what had driven her to fight, to resist. But the risk was undeniable.

“Do you know what you’re asking?” she said, her tone softer now. “If we help you, The Architect will come after you. After all of us.”

“I know,” the figure said. “But I don’t have a choice.”

Back at the sanctuary, the tension was palpable as Tessa, Mileo, and the masked figure faced Sierra in the command room. The older woman’s expression was as hard as ever, her arms crossed as she listened to their story.

“This is reckless,” Sierra said, her voice cold. “We don’t know anything about this person. For all we know, they could be a plant.”

“I’m not,” the figure said, their voice steady despite the weight of Sierra’s scrutiny. “I’ve lost too much to The Architect to ever work for it.”

“And we’re just supposed to take your word for it?” Sierra shot back.

Tessa stepped forward, her gaze unwavering. “We’ve all lost something to The Architect. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we fight. If we stop trusting people, then we’ve already lost.”

Sierra’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t argue. Instead, she turned to Mileo. “What’s the plan?”

Mileo hesitated, glancing at Tessa before speaking. “The extraction site is deep in the central district. High-value target, heavily guarded. We’ll need to disrupt the surveillance grid and create a diversion to get in and out.”

“And what happens if it all goes wrong?” Sierra asked.

Mileo shrugged, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. “Then we improvise. Like always.”

Sierra didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Fine. But if this goes south, it’s on you.”

Later that night, Tessa sat alone in the sanctuary’s common room, her thoughts a whirlwind of uncertainty and resolve. The masked figure’s story had struck a chord with her, dredging up memories she had tried to bury. Memories of the life she had lost, of the people she had failed to save.

She reached for her Ghost Link, its faint glow a reminder of the fight that lay ahead. The Architect was relentless, its presence a constant shadow over their lives. But for every shadow, there was a spark of light. A pulse of dissidence.

And as long as that pulse remained, so would her hope.
