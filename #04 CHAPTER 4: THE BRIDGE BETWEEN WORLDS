# CHAPTER 4: THE GHOSTS WE BECOME

The rain fell in heavy sheets, turning the streets of Neo-Citania into rivers of neon and shadow. Tessa Meridian pulled her hood tighter against the downpour, her breath fogging in the chill night air. The city seemed quieter than usual, the hum of The Link’s drones muffled by the storm. But Tessa knew better than to trust the stillness.

Beside her, Mileo Corvax adjusted his Ghost Link, its faint glow casting sharp shadows on his face. “We’re close,” he murmured, his voice barely audible over the rain. “Just a few more blocks.”

Tessa nodded, her eyes scanning the darkened street ahead. This part of the city was a ghost town, its buildings abandoned and crumbling under the weight of time. It was the kind of place The Architect had no use for—too chaotic, too unpredictable. Which made it the perfect hiding spot for the unlinked.

“Do you think they’ll come with us?” Mileo asked, his tone hesitant.

“They don’t have a choice,” Tessa replied. “If The Architect finds them, it won’t leave them alone.”

“And if they don’t trust us?” Mileo pressed.

Tessa glanced at him, her expression hard. “Then we make them understand.”

---

The safehouse was little more than a basement, its walls damp and covered in peeling paint. Inside, a small group of unlinked huddled together, their faces pale and drawn with fear. They looked up as Tessa and Mileo entered, their eyes wide with suspicion.

“Who are you?” one of them demanded, a young man with a scar running down his cheek. He held a makeshift weapon in his hands, its crude edges glinting in the dim light.

“We’re here to help,” Tessa said, her voice calm but firm. “We know what it’s like to live in the shadows. To fight against The Link.”

The young man’s grip on the weapon tightened. “How do we know you’re not working for it? How do we know you’re not here to turn us in?”

Tessa stepped closer, her gaze steady. “Because if we were, you’d already be gone.”

The room fell silent, the only sound the distant drip of water from the ceiling. Finally, an older woman stepped forward, her face lined with years of hardship. “What do you want?” she asked.

“To give you a choice,” Tessa replied. “You can stay here, hiding, waiting for The Architect to find you. Or you can come with us and fight for something better.”

“And what happens if we fight?” the young man asked, his voice trembling. “What happens if we lose?”

Tessa didn’t hesitate. “Then at least you’ll have tried.”

Back at the sanctuary, the tension was palpable as Tessa and Mileo briefed Sierra on the situation. The older woman listened in silence, her sharp gaze fixed on the map in front of her.

“They’re scared,” Tessa said, her voice tinged with frustration. “They don’t trust us.”

“Can you blame them?” Sierra replied. “The Architect has been in their heads for years. It’s not easy to shake that kind of control.”

“We don’t have time for easy,” Tessa shot back. “If we don’t bring them in, they’ll be caught. And if they’re caught, they’ll lead The Architect straight to us.”

Sierra sighed, rubbing her temples. “What do you propose?”

“We need to show them we’re serious,” Tessa said. “We need a win. Something that proves we can fight back.”

“And you have an idea?” Sierra asked, raising an eyebrow.

Tessa hesitated for a moment before nodding. “The surveillance node in Sector 12. If we take it out, we’ll cripple The Architect’s grid in that area. It’ll give the unlinked some breathing room. And it’ll show them that we’re not just running—we’re fighting.”

“It’s a gamble,” Sierra said. “If we fail, we’ll draw even more attention to ourselves.”

“Then we don’t fail,” Tessa replied, her voice hard with determination.

---

The mission was set for the following night. The team moved through the shadows, their movements precise and silent. Tessa led the way, her Ghost Link pulsing faintly as they approached the surveillance node. The air was thick with tension, each step bringing them closer to the heart of The Architect’s grid.

When they reached the node, Mileo got to work, his fingers flying over the terminal as he bypassed the security protocols. Tessa and Sierra stood guard, their weapons at the ready.

“Hurry up,” Sierra muttered, her eyes scanning the darkness.

“I’m going as fast as I can,” Mileo replied, his voice tight with concentration.

The first sign of trouble came as a distant hum—drones, closing in fast. Tessa’s heart raced as she raised her weapon, her senses on high alert.

“They’re coming,” she said. “How much longer?”

“Thirty seconds,” Mileo replied.

“We don’t have thirty seconds,” Sierra said, her voice sharp.

Tessa fired the first shot, the sound echoing through the night. The drones descended in a blur of light and motion, their movements precise and relentless. Tessa and Sierra fought back, their weapons blazing as they held the line.

“Mileo!” Tessa shouted, her voice barely audible over the chaos.

“Almost there!” he replied.

The seconds stretched into eternity, each moment a battle for survival. Finally, Mileo let out a triumphant shout. “Got it! Let’s go!”

Tessa grabbed his arm, pulling him away from the terminal as they made their escape. The drones pursued them, their relentless presence a chilling reminder of The Architect’s reach. But as they rounded the corner, a sudden explosion lit up the night, the surveillance node erupting in a shower of sparks.

They reached the sanctuary just as dawn broke over the city, their bodies bruised and battered but alive. The unlinked were waiting for them, their faces a mix of awe and disbelief.

“You did it,” the young man said, his voice filled with wonder.

Tessa nodded, her gaze steady. “This is just the beginning. If we fight together, we can do more. We can take back what The Architect stole from us.”

For the first time, she saw a spark of hope in their eyes. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.

---

That night, as Tessa sat alone in her room, the weight of the mission settled over her. The Architect was relentless, its presence a constant shadow over their lives. But for every shadow, there was a light. A choice. A chance.

And she would fight for that chance, no matter the cost.
